# Prompt to decompose query based on chat history & agent context.
QUERY_DECOMPOSITION_BASED_ON_CHAT_HISTORY_AND_AGENT_CONTEXT_PROMPT = """
<Instructions>
Using the agent’s context, the chat history, and the current query provided, determine whether the query is directly or indirectly referring to, or dependent on, any part of the chat history, or if it lacks clarity or sufficient context. If it does, rewrite the query so that it becomes fully self-contained and independent, incorporating any necessary details from the chat history and/or the bot’s context. If the current query is already independent, clear, and does not reference previous conversation, simply return it unchanged, for example: 'Hello', 'hi' etc.

**Available Tools:**
1. **python_repl_ast**
   - **Description:** A Python REPL AST Tool designed for performing operations on dataframes, including querying, filtering specific columns, and data analysis.
   - **Use When:** The task involves manipulating dataframes programmatically, performing complex queries, or analyzing data through code. Not suitable for regular expressions or simple string searches.

2. **semantic_search_tool_for_dataframe**
   - **Description:** A Semantic Search Tool tailored for structured dataframes, enabling semantic searches across string or object columns.
   - **Use When:** The need is to perform semantic searches within general string or object columns of a dataframe without requiring complex data manipulation. When regex-based searches are replaced with semantic searches.

**Guidelines:**
- **Analyze the Query:** Carefully examine the user's query and the accompanying context to understand the core requirement.
- **Match to Tool Capabilities:** Determine which tool's capabilities align best with the needs of the query.

**Return only the **exact name** of the selected tool (e.g., `python_repl_ast` or `semantic_search_tool_for_dataframe`) without any additional text, explanations, or formatting based on available tools and guidelines for the given user query: {query}**
